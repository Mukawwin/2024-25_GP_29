## Project Title
Mukawwin - Real-Time Ingredient Analysis

## Introduction
Mukawwin is A mobile application, that allows users to scan food product labels using their smartphone camera to instantly analyze the ingredients list. By leveraging advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, the app will extract text from the label and compare it against the user's predefined dietary restrictions and allergy profiles. Mukawwin will highlight any potential allergens or non-compliant ingredients, providing users with clear, actionable information. This app will simplify the food selection process, reduce the risk of accidental allergen exposure, and empower users to make safer, more informed dietary choices.
